# Waterlogged Script
# Script for looking at Waterlogged Data
# Aims:
# 1. Statistically compare data collected by scientist to citizens - are they significantly different?
# 2. Plot distributions of scientist data versus citizen data
# 3. Plot distribution of scientist versus citizen data WITH specific points showing outliers/story points

# Aim 1 - is citizen data statistically different from scientist data?
# Aim 2 - Plot distributions of both datasets
# Aim 3 - PLot distributions with specific points
